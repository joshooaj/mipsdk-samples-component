# Milestone Integration Platform Software Development Kit component integration samples

The Milestone Integration Platform (MIP) enables fast and flexible integration between
Milestone XProtect video management software (VMS), applications available from
[Milestone Technology Partner Finder](<https://www.milestonesys.com/partners/technology-partners/technology-partner-finder/>),
and other third-party applications and devices.

The Milestone Integration Platform Software Development Kit (MIP SDK) offers a suite of integration options, including

- protocol integration
- component integration (stand-alone applications using MIP .NET libraries)
- plug-in integration (hosted by XProtect application environments)

This repo contains samples that demonstrate MIP SDK component integration.

The component integration samples cover these key areas of XProtect VMS functionality:

| Functionality                              | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessing configuration and status         | How to read and update configuration as well as monitoring status of the VMS.                                         |
